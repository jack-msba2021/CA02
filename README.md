# Exploring India's Air Pollution Through Data Analysis

## Project Overview
Exploratory data analysis is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their characteristics. It's a very important step in data analysis that should be performed before any real complex statistical methods are conducted. This project attempts to practice the concepts of exploratory data analysis through the [India Air Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shrutibhargava94/india-air-quality-data) downloaded from Kaggle. 

## Requirements
The following can be used to run Python code:

 - [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true)
 - [Jupiter Notebook](https://jupyter.org)
